    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Akash Dass, a digital marketing enthusiast dedicated to enhancing business growth through innovative SEO strategies and diverse digital marketing channels.</p>
    <p>Digital marketing transcends the boundaries of traditional business methods. <br>
         While traditional businesses operate from a physical location, limiting their reach to local customers, a well-optimized business website can attract a global audience. <br>
          By leveraging the power of digital marketing, businesses can expand their customer base and achieve significant growth.

    <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
    <p>My Personal Opinion on Improving SEO <br>
        In my view, the key to enhancing SEO lies in understanding search intent and identifying relevant keywords. <br>
         By grasping what users are truly looking for, businesses can tailor their content to meet those needs effectively. <br> Here’s my approach:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Finding Search Intent:</strong></p> 
                <p>It's crucial to comprehend the underlying intent behind users' search queries. <br>
                 Are they looking for information, seeking to make a purchase, or trying to navigate to a specific site? <br>
                  By understanding these intentions, we can create content that directly addresses users' needs and provides a better user experience.
                </p>  
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Identifying Relevant Keywords:</strong></p>
                <p>Once the search intent is clear, the next step is to find the right keywords that align with this intent. <br>
                    This involves thorough keyword research to discover terms and phrases that potential customers are using. <br>
                  These keywords should be strategically integrated into the content to improve its visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Creating Blogs and Useful Content:</strong></p>
                <p> With the right keywords in hand, the focus should be on generating high-quality blogs and other valuable content. <br>
                     Content should be informative, engaging, and tailored to the interests and needs of the target audience. <br> By consistently producing useful content, businesses can attract and retain visitors, ultimately driving more organic traffic to their website.
                </p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    By focusing on search intent and relevant keywords, and by creating valuable content around these elements, businesses can significantly enhance their SEO efforts and achieve sustainable growth.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
